<h1>Libro: Library Management System</h1>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
Libro is a comprehensive Book Management System designed to facilitate the easy management and discovery of books in a library setting. The primary focus of this project is to design and implement the web APIs that will support the functionality of this application. These APIs will handle user registration and authentication, book transactions, patron profile management, book and author management, and more.

<h3>Main Features:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>User Registration and Authentication:</b> Users can register and log in to the system with different access levels (patrons, librarians, administrators).</li>

<li><b>Searching and Browsing Books:</b> Users can search for books by title, author, genre, and other criteria, and browse all available books. Book information includes details like title, author, publication date, genre, and availability status.</li>

<li><b>Book Transactions:</b> Patrons can reserve available books, librarians can check out books to patrons, and accept returned books. The system tracks due dates for borrowed books and identifies overdue books.</li>

<li><b>Patron Profiles:</b> Patrons can view their own profile, including borrowing history and current or overdue loans. Librarians and administrators can view and edit patron profiles.</li>

<li><b>Book and Author Management:</b> Librarians and administrators can add, edit, or remove books and authors in the system. Administrators can manage librarian accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Reading Lists:</b> Patrons can create and manage custom reading lists.</li>

<li><b>Book Reviews and Ratings:</b> Patrons can rate and review books, and view reviews and ratings by other patrons.</li>

<li><b>Notifications:</b> The system can send notifications to patrons about due dates, reserved books, or other important events.</li>

<li><b>Book Recommendations:</b> The system can provide personalized book recommendations to patrons based on their borrowing history or favorite genres.</li>
</ul>
